## Can buffer strategy be an alternative 60/40 strategy?

The Buffer ETF strategy offers a structured investment approach designed to mitigate downside risk while providing capped upside returns. By employing options-based mechanisms, such as purchasing protective puts and selling covered calls, this strategy creates a "buffer zone" to absorb losses up to a predetermined threshold, offering protection against moderate market declines. Simultaneously, the cap level on gains is determined by market conditions, option costs, and implied volatility. With flexible configurations across buffer levels and maturities, the strategy caters to diverse investor profiles, balancing risk and return preferences. 

Historical analysis from 2014 to 2023 demonstrates the strategy's performance under varying market regimes, highlighting its potential for stability during downturns and modest returns during stable or bullish markets. However, challenges such as rising costs in volatile markets, foregone returns due to capped upside, and the need for effective communication with investors regarding complex valuation dynamics remain. The Buffer ETF strategy appeals to risk-averse investors seeking a disciplined, low-maintenance investment vehicle aligned with defined market scenarios.
